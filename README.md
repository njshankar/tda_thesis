# TDA undergraduate thesis 

Some code and data for my undergraduate thesis TDA analysis of the network of Claremont Colleges mathematicians. 

Toy Persistence Examples.R generates random datasets on some basic shapes and implements persistence homology on them.

Claremont Network Persistence.R implements persistence homology on a dataset of Claremont Colleges mathematicians. 

It uses data from coauthor.csv (matrix of number of papers co-authored for each pair of mathematicians), colabdist.csv (matrix of colabdist between each pair of mathematicians), and labels.csv (the names of each mathematician).
